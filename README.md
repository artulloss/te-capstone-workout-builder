# te-capstone-workout-builder
Final project for Tech Elevator

This project is a workout builder application allowing users to generate a random workout based on their preferences and alotted time.
Users can then log their workout and keep a history of how much they've exercised each day.
Trainers are able to perform basic CRUD operations from a manage exercises panel.
